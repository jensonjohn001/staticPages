<p>Anti-Money Laundering Policy</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I. Linklease Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Policy Statement</p>
<p>It is the policy of Linklease to prohibit and actively prevent money laundering and any activity that facilitates money laundering or the funding of terrorists or criminal activity. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Money laundering is generally defined as engaging in acts designed to conceal or disguise the true origin of criminally derived proceeds so that the unlawful proceeds appear to have derived from legitimate origins or constitute legitimate assets. &nbsp;Generally, money laundering occurs in three stages:</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Placement: Cash generated from criminal activities is converted into monetary instruments, such as money orders or traveler&apos;s checks, or deposited into accounts at financial institutions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Layering: Funds are transferred or moved into other accounts or other financial institutions to further separate the money from its criminal origin.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Integration: Funds are reintroduced into the economy and used to purchase legitimate assets or to fund other criminal activities or legitimate businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Terrorist financing may not involve the proceeds of criminal conduct, but rather an attempt to conceal the origin or intended use of the funds, which will later be used for criminal purposes. Because Linklease platform invites entrepreneurs to inject capital to facilitate asset acquisition for SMEs, there is a very small but real risk of criminal activity through the transfer of funds through electronic means.&nbsp;</p>
<p>II. AML Compliance Officer Designation and Duties</p>
<p>As required under the Law, Linklease designates Helen Molyneux as the Anti-Money Laundering Program Compliance Officer, with full responsibility for the Linklease&apos;s anti-money laundering (AML) program. &nbsp; &nbsp;The AMLCO will ensure:</p>
<p>A.<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The AML Program is implemented effectively, including monitoring compliance by the Linklease&rsquo;s officers and employees with their obligations under the program;</p>
<p>B.<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The AML Program is updated, as necessary; and,</p>
<p>C.<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Appropriate persons are educated and properly trained.</p>
<p>III. Sharing AML Information with Federal Law Enforcement Agencies&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will respond to any Law Enforcement (LE) request about accounts or transactions by immediately searching our records to determine whether we maintain or have maintained any account for, or have engaged in any transaction with, each individual, entity, or organization named in LE&apos;s request. &nbsp;Upon receiving an information request, the AMLCO is to be responsible for responding to the request and similar requests in the future. &nbsp;Unless otherwise stated in LE&apos;s request, we are required to search current accounts and transactions, accounts maintained by a named suspect during the preceding 12 months, and transactions conducted by or on behalf of or with a named subject during the preceding six months. &nbsp;If we find a match, we will report it to LE by completing LE&apos;s subject information form in a timely manner. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We will not disclose the fact that LE has requested or obtained information from us, except to the extent necessary to comply with the information request. &nbsp;We will maintain procedures to protect the security and confidentiality of requests from LE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV. Checking Specifically Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before approving any application which potentially may involve money laundering we will check to ensure that an applicant does not appear on any &ldquo;Specifically Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons&rdquo; List, and is not from, or engaging in transactions with people or entities from, embargoed countries and regions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the event that we determine an applicant, or someone with or for whom the applicant is transacting, is on aforementioned List or is from or engaging in transactions with a person or entity located in an embargoed country or region, we will reject the application and if there is sufficient concern we may report to the UAE authorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>V. Applicant Identification and Verification</p>
<p>We have established, documented, and maintained a written Applicant Identification Program. &nbsp;We will collect certain minimum applicant identification information from each applicant and provide notice to applicants that we will seek identification information and compare applicant identification information with government-provided lists of suspected terrorists as mentioned above in Section III.</p>
<p>A. Required Applicant Information</p>
<p>Prior to approving an application, we will different information from all applicants. We will not approve an application in the event that an applicant has applied for, but has not provided identification to the satisfaction of the AML policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>B. Applicants Who Refuse To Provide Information</p>
<p>If a potential or existing applicant either refuses to provide the information described above when requested, or appears to have intentionally provided misleading information, the Linklease will reject the application. &nbsp;In either case, our AML Compliance Officer will be notified so that we can determine whether we should report the situation to LE.</p>
<p>C. Verification of Information</p>
<p>We will verify applicant identity through documentary evidence, non-documentary evidence, or both. &nbsp;We will use documents to verify applicant identity when appropriate documents are available. &nbsp;In light of the increased instances of identity fraud, we may supplement the use of documentary evidence by using the non-documentary means described below whenever possible. &nbsp;We may also use such non-documentary means, after using documentary evidence, if we are still uncertain about whether we know the true identity of the applicant. &nbsp;In analyzing the verification information, we will consider whether there is a logical consistency among the identifying information provided, such as the applicant&apos;s name, street address, P.O.Box, telephone number (if provided), date of birth, and ID number.</p>
<p>We may use any or all of following non-documentary methods of verifying identity:</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Contacting an applicant;</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Independently verifying the applicant&apos;s identity through the comparison of information provided by the applicant with information obtained from a consumer reporting agency, public database, employer or other source;</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Checking references with financial institutions;</p>
<p>We will use non-documentary methods of verification in the following situations: (1) when the applicant is unable to present an unexpired government-issued identification document with a photograph or other similar safeguard; (2) when the Linklease is unfamiliar with the documents the applicant presents for identification verification; (3) when there are other circumstances that increase the risk that the Linklease will be unable to verify the true identity of the applicant through documentary means.</p>
<p>E. Recordkeeping</p>
<p>We will maintain records of all identification information and verification information obtained for five years after the application is received.</p>
<p>F. Notice to Applicants</p>
<p>We will provide notice to applicants that the Linklease is requesting information from them to verify their identities, as required by UAE law. &nbsp;We will give notice to applicants regarding the policy either verbally or as a plainly posted notice.</p>
<p>To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires us to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who applies for financial services OR injects money onto the platform. &nbsp;We will ask for your name, address and other information that will allow us to identify you. &nbsp;We may also ask to see your driver&apos;s license or other identifying documents.</p>
<p>VI. Foreign Correspondent Accounts and Foreign Shell Banks</p>
<p>It is our policy that the Linklease may not provide any services on the GROW platform when we have a reasonable cause to believe a foreign bank or foreign financial institution is involved in any way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>VII. Monitoring Loans for Suspicious Activity</p>
<p>1. Detecting Red Flags</p>
<p>Red flags that signal possible money laundering or terrorist financing include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The applicant exhibits unusual concern about the Linklease&rsquo;s compliance with government reporting requirements and is reluctant or refuses to reveal any information concerning personal finances, or furnishes unusual or suspicious identification or documents.</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The information provided by the applicant that identifies a legitimate source for funds is false, misleading, or substantially incorrect.</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Upon request, the applicant refuses to identify or fails to indicate any legitimate source for his or her funds and other assets when making large early payments.</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The applicant (or a person publicly associated with the applicant) has a questionable background or is the subject of news reports indicating possible criminal, civil, or regulatory violations.</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The applicant exhibits a lack of concern regarding costs.</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The applicant has difficulty describing the nature of his or her business.</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The applicant makes unexplained or sudden early payments.</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The applicant requests that a transaction be processed to avoid the Linklease&rsquo;s normal documentation requirements.</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The applicant has inflows of funds or other assets well beyond the known income or resources of the applicant.</p>
<p>2. Responding to Red Flags and Suspicious Activity</p>
<p>When a member of the Linklease detects any red flag he or she will investigate further under the direction of the AML Compliance Officer. &nbsp;This may include gathering additional information internally or from third-party sources, contacting the government. Linklease is obligated to report suspicious transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Linklease is provided with the same &ldquo;safe harbor&rdquo; as provided for other financial institutions protecting lenders and their employees recognizing they must feel free to report suspicious transactions, and to share information in the employment context about individuals involved in misconduct, without fear of liability.</p>
<p>VII. AML Record Keeping</p>
<p>A. Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) Maintenance and Confidentiality</p>
<p>We will hold SAR and any supporting documentation confidential. &nbsp;We will not inform anyone outside of a law enforcement or regulatory agency about a SAR. We will segregate SAR filings and copies of supporting documentation from other Linklease books and records to avoid disclosing SAR filings. &nbsp;</p>
<p>B. Responsibility for AML Records and SAR Filing</p>
<p>Our AML Compliance Officer and his or her designee will be responsible to ensure that AML records are maintained properly and that any SARs are filed as required.</p>
<p>C. Records Required</p>
<p>As part of our AML program, the Linklease will create and maintain SAR and other relevant documentation on applicant identity and verification and fund transfers and transmittals as well as any records related to applicants listed on the prohibited list. &nbsp;We will maintain SAR and their accompanying documentation for at least five years.</p>
<p>VIII. Monitoring Employee Conduct and Accounts</p>
<p>We will subject employee money related transactions to the same AML procedures as applicant accounts, under the supervision of the AML Compliance Officer. &nbsp;The AML Compliance Officer&apos;s accounts will be reviewed by a qualified member of the Linklease officers.</p>
<p>IX. Confidential Reporting of AML Non-Compliance</p>
<p>Employees will report any violations of the firm&apos;s AML compliance program to the AML Compliance Officer, unless the violations implicate the Compliance Officer, in which case the employee shall report to an appropriate member of senior management. &nbsp;Such reports will be confidential, and the employee will suffer no retaliation for making them.</p>
<p>XIII. Additional Areas of Risk</p>
<p>The Linklease has reviewed all areas of its business to identify potential money laundering risks that may not be covered in the procedures described above and is continually working to improve its AML program.</p>
