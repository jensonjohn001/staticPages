<p>We established Linklease in 2015 in the United Arab Emirates to provide SMEs across the region with an alternative to traditional sources of finance. That alternative is leasing; ensuring our clients can gain access to the most sophisticated equipment they need to develop their businesses whilst at the same time, keeping their valuable cash and credit facilities free for other purposes.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We cater to a broad range of industries including construction, healthcare, logistics, manufacturing and printing, to name just a few. In delivering alternative means for SMEs to optimise their use of fixed assets, we also facilitate opportunities for global fixed income investors. That means connecting institutions looking to participate in the regional SME equipment market with our clients who are looking to use that exact same equipment.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>While continuing our traditional business model, we decided to take our business online into Linklease GROW, an online crowdfunding platform. Whether you’re a business owner or investor, you can be assured that in working with Linklease, you’re working with seasoned professionals. With over 25 years of specialist experience in SME asset-based financing, our team has already delivered deals to the tune of $1 billion across more than 3,500 transactions.</p>

<p>Whilst the numbers speak for themselves, if you’d like to speak with us, don’t hesitate to get in touch today to find out how we can meet your leasing or investment needs.</p>
