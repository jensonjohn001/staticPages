<p>Know Your Customer (KYC) as a business function has become increasingly important worldwide to prevent money laundering, terrorism financing, identity theft and financial fraud.&nbsp;<br>“KYC” refers to the steps taken by a financial institution (or business) to:<br>• Establish customer identity<br>• Understand the nature of the customer’s activities (primary goal is to satisfy that the source of the customer’s funds is legitimate)<br>• Assess money laundering risks associated with that customer for purposes of monitoring the customer’s activities<br>The minimum requirements to open an individual financial account are:&nbsp;<br>• Name<br>• Date of birth<br>• Address<br>• Identification number<br>• Identification document<br>While gathering this information during account opening is sufficient, Linklease will verify the identity of the account holder “within a reasonable time.” Procedures for identity verification include documents, non-documentary methods (these may include comparing the information provided by the customer with consumer reporting agencies, public databases, among other due diligence measures), or a combination of both.<br>For any institution, one of the first analysis made is to determine if you can trust a potential client. You need to make sure a potential customer is trustworthy; customer due diligence (CDD) is a critical element of effectively managing your risks and protecting yourself against criminals, terrorists, and Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) who might present a risk.<br>There are three levels of due diligence:<br>• Simplified Due Diligence (“SDD”) are situations where the risk for money laundering or terrorist funding is low and a full CDD is not necessary. For example, low value accounts or accounts.<br>• Basic Customer Due Diligence (“CDD”) is information obtained for all customers to verify the identity of a customer and asses the risks associated with that customer.<br>• Enhanced Due Diligence (“EDD”) is additional information collected for higher-risk customers to provide a deeper understanding of customer activity to mitigate associated risks. In the end, while some EDD factors are specifically enshrined in a country’s legislations, it’s up to a financial institution to determine their risk and take measures to ensure that their customers are not bad actors.<br>Some practical steps to Linklease includes in your due diligence program include:<br>• Ascertain the identity and location of the potential customer and gain a good understanding of their business activities. This can be as simple as locating documentation that verifies the name and address of your customer.<br>• When authenticating or verifying a potential customer, classify their risk category and define what type of customer they are, before storing this information and any additional documentation digitally.<br>• Beyond basic CDD, it’s important that you carry out the correct processes to ascertain whether EDD is necessary. This can be an ongoing process, as existing customers have the potential to transition into higher risk categories over time; in that context, conducting periodic due diligence assessments on existing customers can be beneficial. Factors one must consider to determine whether EDD is required, include, but are not limited to, the following:<br>o Location of the person<br>o Occupation of the person<br>o Type of transactions<br>o Expected pattern of activity in terms of transaction types, dollar value and frequency<br>o Expected method of payment<br>• Keeping records of all the CDD and EDD performed on each customer, or potential customer, is necessary in case of a regulatory audit.<br>It’s not enough to just check your customer once, you need to have a program to monitor your customer on an ongoing basis. The ongoing monitoring function includes oversight of financial transactions and accounts based on thresholds developed as part of a customer’s risk profile.<br>Just as individual accounts require identification, due diligence and monitoring, corporate accounts require KYC procedures as well. While the process bears similarity to KYC for individual customers, its requirements are different; additionally, transaction volumes, transaction amounts, and other risk factors, &nbsp;are usually more pronounced so the procedures are more involved. These procedures are often referred to as Know Your Business (KYB).<br>While each jurisdiction has its own KYB requirements, here are four general steps to implement an effective program:<br>Retrieve Company Vitals<br>Identify and verify an accurate company record such as information regarding register number, company name, address, status, and key management personnel. While the specific information that you gather depends on the jurisdiction and your fraud prevention standards, you’ll need to systematically gather the information and input it into your workflows.<br>Analyze Ownership Structure and Percentages<br>Determine the entities or natural-persons who have an ownership stake, either through direct ownership or through another party.<br>Identify Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs)<br>Calculate the total ownership stake, or management control, of any natural-person and determine if it crosses the threshold for UBO reporting.<br>Perform AML/KYC Checks on Individuals<br>For all individuals that are determined to be a UBO, perform AML/KYC checks.<br>&nbsp;</p>
